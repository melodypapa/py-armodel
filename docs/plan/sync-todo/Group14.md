# Sync todo: Group 14 — ServiceNeeds & Diagnostics

Input: full-repo orphan audit 2026-09-23 (unstamped ∧ untracked, M2 only) · Queue order = row order
(resume = first class row still `[ ]`; all class rows `[x]` = sync finished — Rule 0017.3)
> **Rule — already-verified short-circuit (added 2026-09-04):** before running the 9-step
> sync for a row, check whether the class already carries `# Spec verified: <RELEASE>` or
> `# XSD verified: <xsd-file>` in its own class body (verify the marker in the source — a
> row in this todo is not proof). If it does **and** a quick deviation check finds nothing
> new (base vs the spec `Base` closure, member types vs its table, verbatim docstrings,
> reader/writer coverage, checklist shape per Rules 0002/0012), **skip the 9 steps**: mark
> the row `- [x] <Class> — already verified (<marker>, <file>)` and move on. If the check
> finds a new deviation, do **not** mark it verified — keep the row queued, run the steps
> for the deviation only, and record it in Step 8 (Rule 0012.3: an existing marker is not
> proof).

> **Parent-dependency audit 2026-09-26 (all Group1-20 pending rows, spec-table Base chains):** every pending row's Base row extracted from the R23-11/R4.3.1 markdown (260/293 found; 33 = enums/XSD-only/user-arbitrated) and every parent classified against src stamps + the queue. Findings: DiagnosticEnvCompareCondition (Group14) and MixedContentForUnitNames (Group8) queued NEW above their children; DiagnosticEnvModeElement row-header Base corrected. ESTABLISHED SKIPS (no rows, per precedent): UploadableDesignElement / UploadablePackageElement (attribute-less abstract bases, empty XSD groups — most-derived-base collapse, Group5-audit precedent; appear in Base cells of the DiagnosticExtract family this file queues); AREnum leaf classes (no Base row by construction); the Firewall member-rule family (user arbitration 2026-08-31: no Class table in either corpus → skipped, see Group1 FirewallRule Done row); ARList (resolved under "List", FO GST Table 9.8, Group9 row).
