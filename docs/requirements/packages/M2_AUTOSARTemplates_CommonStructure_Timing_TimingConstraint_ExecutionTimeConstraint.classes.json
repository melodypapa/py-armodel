The time to execute the executable including interruptions by other entities and including external calls is commonly called \"response time\". The TimingExtensions provide the concept of event chains and latency constraints for that purpose. An event chain from the start of the entity to the termination of the entity with according latency constraint represents a response time constraint for that executable entity.",
