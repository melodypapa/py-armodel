      "note": "This constraint is used to restrict the timing behavior of different, but correlated events or event chains, with regard to synchronization. Two scenarios are supported: • If (synchronizationConstraintType==responseSynchronization) – TimingDescriptionEvents: An arbitrary number of correlated events which play the role of responses shall occur synchronously with respect to a predefined tolerance. – TimingDescriptionEventChains: An arbitrary number of correlated event chains with a common stimulus, but different responses, where the responses shall occur synchronously with respect to a predefined tolerance. • If (synchronizationConstraintType==stimulusSynchronization) – TimingDescriptionEvents:An arbitrary number of correlated events which play the role of stimuli shall occur synchronously with respect to a predefined tolerance. – TimingDescriptionEventChains: An arbitrary number of correlated event chains with a common response, but different stimuli, where the stimuli shall occur synchronously with respect to a predefined tolerance. In case the constraint is imposed on events the following two scenarios are supported: • If (eventOccurrenceKind==singleOccurrence): any of the events shall occur only once in the given time interval. • If (eventOccurrenceKind==multipleOccurrences): any of the events may occur more than once in the given time interval. In other words multiple occurrences of an event within the given time interval are permitted.",
